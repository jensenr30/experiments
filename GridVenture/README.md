#GridVenture
*A sandbox adventure rpg*

###About
This is a game like Terraria, but it will be much more story oriented. I want to make a complex event/quest system that will allow the user to take many different paths through the game.

###Playing the Game
To play the game, simply download the release from mediafire here:

[GridVenture 0.3 - .7z](http://www.mediafire.com/download/744baw4posktrwu/GridSim_v0.3.7z)

[GridVenture 0.3 - .zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download/a6thag5j9bzg34i/GridSim_v0.3.zip)

*Note: Release Version 0.3 was the latest release of the game before it was taken in a different direction. The game is currently goin in an adventure/rpg direction. When v0.3 was released, the game was a simulation type game. However, it was still pretty fun. So do try it out regardless.*

Alternatively, navigate to the **bin/Release History/** directory. There you will find every release version of the game - including the latest one.
*(Note: if a release folder does not contain a .zip and a .7z file, that means that release is currently being built)*



There are some "interesting" gems in the **bin/Debug/** directory. There are several version of the game in there that were not official releases, but I thought were noteworthy in some way and wanted to save the exe of that build.

###Google Doc for Story Development
[GoogleDoc](https://drive.google.com/#folders/0BwrDfvTqlcwKZldBWTZhdWNFc0E) This folder is **public** and anyone can comment on it. (**protip: Press Ctrl+Alt+M to comment on a document.**

###Concept Art
[Tumblr Blog](http://jensensketch.tumblr.com/) This is the blog for concept art for the game. And generally whatever Jensen/Domo feels like drawing.

###Compiling GridSim

follow [lazyfoo's tutorial to setup SDL2](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) on your computer. You will need to have some experience compiling software to get everything set up on your computer.

Using code::blocks as an IDE will be much easier than compiling otherwise.

The following linker setting should already be added to the Code::Blocks configuration files:

-lcomdlg32

-lmingw32

-lSDL2main

-lSDL2

-lSDL2_image

-lSDL2_ttf
