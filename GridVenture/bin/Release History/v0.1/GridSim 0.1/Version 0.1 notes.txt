Grid Sim
Version 0.1
Released 2013-10-27 (October 27th, 2013)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Developer's Notes:

1.	The panning is a bit jerky at the moment.
	A man by the name of Patar has suggested that I tie the panning controls to the mouse.
	I intend to do that.
	
2.	The controls for placing materials have always been fairly poor.
	Josh Pohl is currently working on making them better, more intuitive, and more powerful.
	
3.	I'm planing on taking the game in a different direction soon.
	I'm thinking of an adveture/building/sandbox type game.
	This game should turn into something more than other sandbox games in that the environment will be very dynamic.
	The environment will at times work with you, and at other times work against you.
