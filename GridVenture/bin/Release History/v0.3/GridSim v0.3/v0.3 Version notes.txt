Grid Sim
Version 0.3
Released 2013-10-29 (October 29th, 2013) 11:29 PM GMT -6:00

--------------------------------------------------------------

Updates:
	
1.	Gravity was changed. The "physics" are much better now.
	Pre-v0.3, water wouldn't fill small spaces or the underside of non-gravity materials that were submerged in water
	Now water (along with all of the other liquid/gradual grade gravity obeying material) will act nicer to us all.
	
2.	Pipes were added. This new material was the motivation behing renovating the gravity engine a second time.
	Pipes were suggested by Michael Nowotcznski, "nski". Thanks, bro.
	
3.	Updated the "HOW TO PLAY.txt" document
