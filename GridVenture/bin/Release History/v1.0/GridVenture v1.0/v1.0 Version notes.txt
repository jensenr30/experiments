		The game has just taken a sharp turn from being a
	simulation type game to an adventure RPG game. Much of the
	work done thus far is invisible to the user. Most of the
	things added since v0.3 have been a foundation upon which
	the rest of the game will be built.
		When you move around, it may seem very shakey and
	irritating to look at. This is because, while the motion
	of the player is calculated using floating point
	calculations, the effective position of the player is
	expressed using discrete integers. This will be fixed in a
	later update.
