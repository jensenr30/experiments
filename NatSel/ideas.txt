There are species.
each individual has a genetic "code" which is a randomly generated string of characters (exactly like a name)
only individuals with a difference in genetic code less than a certain amount can mate.
This allows the branching and budding off of new species from existing ones.

When two lifeforms mate, they each pass on half of their own genes.
the father randomly selects half of his genes and passes them on.
the mother randomly selects half of her genes and passes them on.
the child then has two sets of genes (just like in real life sexual reproduction)
the child will have a maternal and paternal set.

example: Lets suppose that a child inherits attack genes of 8 and 10.
The child will exhibit an attack of 10. The "weaker" gene (the one that is lesser) is said to be recessive.
I think, in this way, weak genes won't be immediately eradicated from the population.
Genes for bad fighting skills will most definitely not be favored, but they will not exhibited in many of the lifeforms that carry them.

INTELLIGENCE
i should add intelligence
maybe the intelligence would normally start really low
and it would have to increase through mutation
but it would be really really useful, so evolution would favor it

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENES THAT CONTROL EXPRESSION OF OTHER GENES
e.g. there should be an aggression gene that determines how likely a lifeform is to want to attack (use attack gene)
there might also be a submissive gene that determines how likely a lifeform is to run away from a fight (use speed gene)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPECIES STRING THROUGH THE GENERATIONS
Mixing species strings? should the species string be a mixture of the parent's species strings?
for parents that are the same species, this would not matter.
However, mixing might end up producing some kind of "average" species over time.
This seems boring.
However, there is the option to add a gene that determines the liklihood of the parent's species mixing instead of just being either the mother's or the father's.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SEXUAL PREFERANCE
There should be a third parameter for every trait (e.g. attack[0], attack[1], and a new third attack[2])
attack[2] would describe how desirable the attack[0] trait is in a potential mate.
so when two members of a species of the opposite sex meet, each one would compare the other's attack[0] with their own attack[2].
they would try to find mates that fell within a certain percentage of their target.

so, imagine that a female has a target attack (attack[2]) of 10.
She will be more likely to mate with a male that has an attack of 9 than she is to mate with another male with an attack of 15.
There might have to be a small amount of random probability thrown in there (to simulate the randomness of organism's behaviors).

Children should inherit sexual preferences from their own gender parent.
i.e. daughters inherit sexual preference exclusively from their mothers.
likewise, sons would inherit sexual preference exclusively from their fathers.
This would allow gender roles to build up in species.
This could get interesting...
