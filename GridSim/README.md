##GridSim Repo
*A repo for JP and Jensen where we write programs collaboratively.*

In this repository, the .exe is NOT updated with the project. It is ignored for ease of committing and merging. If you want the lastest copy of GridSim, ask either Jensen (me) or JP by sending one of us a good old fashioned email!

Or you can easily check out **bin/Release History** for allegedly stable builds of the game

**conventions:**
