bottom feeders cannot have two saturation effects.
one overwrites the other.
I think this has something to do with the saturation loop in the cell_engine.


maybe fix the pipe issue where it only sends up one water at a time.
maybe that could be fixed by adding a second saturation effect.
or maybe just an affect mat.
maybe make the first saturation effect be transporting its water up to the next one and the 
or maybe just make it all random. slow that shit down a little bit and make it look less weird.
that might work.
