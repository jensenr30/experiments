Josh Pohl (JPisaBrony) found the following bugs:
	if you use extremely large data for the feilds, it doesn't display anything or it just eats ram and doesn't stop, lol
	if you put \n as the first character's in the file, the progam will just eat ram
	actually, its just a forward slash \ character on its own line, but it has to be the first one
Jensen's knee-jerk reaction:
	large data in the field causing the program to misbehave could be an internal arbitrary limit on the string size that can be input...
	\ character causes a problem? hmmm... that is weird. I didn't think I treated those specially... Is a file I/O function expecting an escape character or something??
