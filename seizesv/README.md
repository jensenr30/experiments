seizesv
===========

Seize your CSV files, with seizesv! (pronounced "seize S. V.")

This program is written in C

The goal is to use the SDL2 graphics library to QUICKLY plot and analyze data from .csv files.

I will try to focus on:

- making the program easy to use and have an intuitive gui

- making the program lightweight

- ensuring the program remains cross-platform (SDL2 helps me out quite a bit here)

- making the program organize data, but NEVER distort it.

- testing the plots to make sure they are exactly accurate.
