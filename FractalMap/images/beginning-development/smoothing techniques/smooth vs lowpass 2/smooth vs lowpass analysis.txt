to smooth the same input signal, block smooth needed nearly 100 times as more iterations as filter_lowpass did.

They two filters achieved (visually) similar results.

both filters look very symmetrical in their filtering.

The obvious advantage of the low-pass filter is that it takes exponentially less time to achieve a (in my opinion) better result.
