This folder contains different techniques used to filter the image


local averaging
	slower (requires exponentially more evaluations as the desired cut-off frequency increasees linearly.
	iterations run: held down mouse for at least 10 seconds on full smoothing (passing an argument of 1 to the function).
	

filter_lowpass_2D_f - cutoff=11.5, iterations=9
	This image was created using the filter_lowpass_2D_f() function.
	the cutoff frequency was set to 11.5 pixels.
	the function only went through 9 iterations.
	The function only needs to go through two or three iterations to get nice smooth filtering.
	A single low pass will usually not provide smooth enough results.
	It is better to lower your cutoff frequency and filter twice or three times.
	This method is much faster than the local averaging function
