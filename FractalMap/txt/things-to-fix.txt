why in the hell do I have
"block_generate_children"
and
"block_create_children"
?
I need to do some serious naming renovation in that section.
all names should be changed to generate.




block_generate_neighbor() needs to be completed AND tested.
So far, I think it has only been partially written. And I don't think it has been tested at all.
